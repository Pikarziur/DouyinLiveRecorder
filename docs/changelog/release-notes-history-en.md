# README Changelog Archive (English)

> Moved out of the "Changelog" section of `README_EN.md` on 2026-09-28; entry bodies are verbatim. The root document keeps only the current release window plus a pointer here.
> 18 entries, 2024-07-13 ~ 2026-09-03.
> On restoration: an earlier doc-size pass had cut some sentences short at a trailing `…`. This volume restores them by **per-line prefix match** against the `.workbuddy/docold` baseline (2026-09-25): 113 lines restored, 0 left as-is for a missing match, 0 left as-is as ambiguous.
> Deliberately NOT done: previously deleted bullets are not resurrected, and file inventories already externalized to `docs/agent-reference/changelog-file-inventories.md` are not re-inlined - wholesale restoration would undo those intentional edits.
> The runtime never reads this archive and it is not part of the shipped artifact. Root document entry point: [README_EN.md](../../README_EN.md).

### v4.0.9.4 (2026-09-03 ~ 2026-09-06) — HLS capture exclusion list / quality-option add-drop & inline switching / P0 segmented-container mismatch fix / packaging defect fix / repo-wide comment completion & metadata sync

> This cycle (v4.0.9.4, 2026-09-03 ~ 09-06) is a consistency and quality wrap-up batch. New: an HLS capture exclusion-platform list config, and user-addable/droppable quality options with inline quality switching in GUI/WEB. Two high-severity issues fixed — Douyin original-quality HEVC was unrecordable due to a segmented-container mismatch (P0), and a cross-loop coroutine warning made pytest warnings fluctuate; also fixed a `pyproject.toml` packaging defect (undeclared sub-packages made `pip install .` emit an incomplete distribution). Also completed repo-wide Chinese comment completion (41 files / +1370 lines), eight-file metadata sync, and four-language catalog completion (516→521). **No breaking changes** (all runtime semantics preserved; the PEP 758 parenthesis-free `except` form only affects <3.14 — this repo's floor is 3.14, an established convention rather than a regression). See [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md) for full root-cause analysis and verification.

**✨ New Features**
- **HLS capture exclusion-platform list**: new config key `HLS采集排除平台(逗号分隔)` — listed platforms ignore the "是否启用HLS采集" (enable HLS capture) switch and always use FLV capture; platforms outside the list keep HLS-first behavior. Supports Chinese/English comma separators and per-loop hot reload.
- **Quality-option add/drop + inline switching**: quality options changed from a fixed 10-tier engine whitelist to a user-selected subset (stored in `config.ini` [录制设置] custom quality options); GUI quality monitor gains a "Switch quality" menu and WEB gains a `PUT /api/rooms/quality` endpoint — picking a non-default quality writes back as `quality,live-room-address` and takes effect on the next loop, while picking the default quality removes the quality segment and falls back to the global default.
- **Standalone single-file build moved to `scripts/`**: `douyin_live_recorder_standalone.py` relocated from the repo root into `scripts/`, so the run command gains a `scripts/` prefix; ffmpeg location logic was fixed after the move (probe in order: script-sibling `ffmpeg/` → repo-root `ffmpeg/` → PATH).

**🐛 Fixes**
- **P0 segmented-recording container mismatch**: Douyin original-quality HEVC was unrecordable because the TS+segment branch used the `ipod` container for `-segment_format`, causing `-c copy` to exit with `AVERROR(EINVAL)` (Windows exit code 4294967274); H.264 instead silently produced a corrupt "MP4 content + .ts extension" file. The "output extension → inner container" mapping was consolidated into a module-level constant `SEGMENT_FORMAT_BY_SUFFIX` with `tests/test_record_container.py` pinning the assertions; also fixed `src/spider.py`'s `hevc_flv_url` missing `&codec=h265`, which had caused h265 detection to be missed.
- **Flaky warning root-caused**: `src/async_http.py` dropped the cross-loop `run_coroutine_threadsafe(client.aclose(), ...)` dispatch branch (root cause: when the old loop had stopped but not closed, the coroutine was never awaited and GC raised "never awaited"); `pyproject.toml` now explicitly filters the third-party starlette/anyio deprecation warning, finalizing the pytest zero-warning gate.
- **GUI quality-switch three defects**: key-format mismatch (serial-number prefix caused the lookup table to miss), persistence loss (the editor still held the pre-write snapshot and got overwritten on save), and display reset (the table read stale subprocess log values) — after switching, the serial-number prefix is stripped before lookup, the editor snapshot is synced after write-back, and the display follows the config file.
- **Packaging defect fix**: `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.setuptools].packages` changed from `["src"]` to `["src", "src.platforms", "src.proto"]`, fixing the `ModuleNotFoundError` at runtime when `pip install .` omitted `src/platforms` (per-platform danmaku collectors) and `src/proto` (Douyin protobuf).

**🛠️ Repo Maintenance & Quality Gates**
- **Repo-wide Chinese comment completion**: 41 files / +1370 lines (average density 7.6%→20.4%), proven logic-neutral by AST equivalence; added `scripts/check_annotations.py` (comment lint + AST equivalence check, three modes) wired into the `ci.yml` `static` job.
- **Eight-file metadata sync**: using `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth, corrected version / path / directory-list / dependency drift across `AGENTS.md`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, and `.coveragerc-concurrency`.
- **Four-language catalog completion**: 5 missing strings added via `extract_i18n_strings.py`, all four catalogs re-aligned (521 entries each), `zh_CN.mo` recompiled (`--check` passes byte-level).
- **Test-output self-cleanup**: `tests/conftest.py` gained a `pytest_unconfigure` hook that deletes `tests/_out_live` / `tests/_out_e2e` after each session.

**🧪 Tests & Verification**
- Full `pytest` **858 passed / 2 skipped / 0 warnings**; `pytest tests/test_i18n.py` 34 passed (four-catalog key-set consistency).
- `mypy` / `basedpyright` (0 error / 0 warning) / `black --check` / `isort --check` / `scripts/check_annotations.py` all green; `scripts/extract_i18n_strings.py` 0 missing; `scripts/compile_po.py --check` in sync with `.po` (522 entries); `scripts/check_version.py` PASS.

### v4.0.9.3 (2026-09-02) — Full fixes for all 20 code-review findings (cookie-cache singleflight rewrite / Web non-ASCII password login crash / probe exception logging & throttle self-cleanup / 64-bit ctypes handle truncation / connection-resource lifecycle) + repo-wide mypy type-clean (tests / gui_legacy / scripts / standalone)

> This version is the full closure batch for the 20 findings of the Code Review Report, plus a repo-wide mypy static-type clean-up (0 issues across 102 source files, for the first time covering tests / gui_legacy / scripts and the standalone single-file build beyond the CI scope). Two high-priority fixes: ① the cookie cache's concurrent dedup was rewritten in singleflight style — the old implementation held a thread-affine `threading.RLock` across `await`, so concurrent coroutines in the same event loop could all re-enter the lock and mutual exclusion was completely void, with coroutines still hammering the same URL (precisely the risk-control trigger this module exists to eliminate); ② the Web panel's legacy plaintext-password compatibility path raised `TypeError` on non-ASCII passwords (`hmac.compare_digest` cannot compare str containing Chinese, making `/api/login` return a hard 500). The eight medium-priority items cover the Web API write path, the backup daemon's tight loop, probe exception logging and unbounded throttle dictionaries, 64-bit handle truncation, decorator fallback types, HTTP connection leaks, duplicate-implementation consolidation, and Session lifecycle; the eight low-priority items are redundancy and style cleanups. **No breaking changes** (runtime semantics such as cookie-cache TTL / no-cache-on-failure / probe backoff and throttling / Web API route contracts are all preserved). For detailed root cause and verification, see [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**🍪 Cookie-cache concurrent-dedup rewrite (high-priority fix)**
- **Root cause**: `fetch_cookies` originally held a `threading.RLock` across `await` — an RLock is thread-affine, and concurrent coroutines inside the same event loop all belong to one thread and could re-enter the lock, so mutual exclusion was completely void; coroutines kept concurrently requesting the same URL (precisely the risk-control trigger this module exists to eliminate).
- **Singleflight rewrite**: a `threading.Lock` now protects only the synchronous reads/writes of the cache dict plus the in-flight registry `_inflight` (**never awaiting while holding the lock**); the coroutine that wins the pull right fetches once, same-loop waiters register a future and reuse the same result, and cross-loop waiters are delivered via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` (futures are not thread-safe — calling `set_result` across threads directly is forbidden).
- **Robustness**: when the fetching coroutine is cancelled (room stopped / process exit), the `BaseException` branch immediately deregisters and delivers an empty result to waiters; waiters carry a `timeout + 5s` margin as a fallback (preventing a permanent hang if the fetch thread dies abnormally); existing semantics — no caching on failure, TTL expiry, `fetcher` pass-through — are all preserved.
- Effect: with multiple rooms of the same platform recording concurrently, the visitor cookie for the same domain is no longer requested repeatedly, further lowering risk-control trigger probability.

**🔐 Web panel & system-tray defect fixes (high / medium-high / medium)**
- **Non-ASCII plaintext-password login 500**: the legacy plaintext compatibility path of `verify_web_password` now compares UTF-8 bytes via `hmac.compare_digest` (the str comparison does not support non-ASCII — a legacy plaintext password containing Chinese made `/api/login` return a hard 500); the PBKDF2 branch also drops the redundant `binascii.Error` catch (a subclass of `ValueError`) and the unused import.
- **Unified Web API write path**: `PUT /api/rooms` now writes rows through `normalize_url` — the old write did not normalize the URL, inconsistent with the dedup criteria of add/delete/toggle, so a row written back by PUT could never be matched again in the next round.
- **64-bit ctypes handle truncation**: `web_tray.py` switches to `ctypes.WinDLL` with full explicit `argtypes`/`restype` declarations (`GetConsoleWindow.restype = c_void_p`), fixing HWND/HMENU truncation by the default `c_int` on 64-bit; module-level `_KERNEL32`/`_USER32` singleton caches (following the `web.py` conventions).

**🛡️ Daemon-thread & probe robustness (medium)**
- **Backup daemon tight loop**: in `config_io.py`, `time.sleep(600)` is moved out of `try` — the old exception branch did not wait, so persistent check_md5/backup failures degraded into a tight loop spinning hot, flooding logs and burning CPU.
- **Probe exception logging & recheck semantics**: `_confirm_get_ok` in `stream_select.py` gains `logger.debug` (with exception type + attempt number — no more silent swallowing), and an attempt-0 exception retries once after `_recheck_delay()` per the "retry before convicting" semantics, giving up the recheck only if both attempts raise (the HEAD conclusion stays "pass").
- **Throttle-dictionary self-cleanup**: `_throttle_probe` now evicts hosts idle for more than `_PROBE_MIN_HOST_INTERVAL × 10` while writing, so `_probe_last_seen` no longer grows unboundedly (mirroring the expiry-cleanup strategy of `_probe_backoff`; prevents unbounded growth over long runs with 60+ platforms); the `mark_ffmpeg_reject`/`clear_ffmpeg_reject` pure-forwarding wrappers are merged into module-level aliases, and a new `_is_h265()` removes the duplicated check in two places.
- **Danmaku sidecar logging**: the write-failure branch of `_write_line` in `danmaku_monitor.py` gains `logger.debug`, consistent with the module's "swallow all exceptions but always leave a trace" convention — sidecar data is no longer dropped without a trace.
- **Cancellation no longer swallowed**: the heartbeat-task reaper's `except asyncio.CancelledError, Exception:` in `ws_client.py` is split — `CancelledError` is only swallowed when hb_task itself is cancelled as expected; if the current coroutine is cancelled, it re-raises.

**♻️ Resource management & fallback types (medium)**
- **Decorator fallback types**: the shared decorator implementation in `utils.py` is consolidated into `_make_trace_error_guard(func, fallback)`, adding `trace_error_decorator_or_none` (returns `None` on error), with error logs now naming both the function and the fallback value type.
- **Eliminating "errors disguised as normal results"**: 5 str/tuple-returning functions in `spider.py` (`get_bilibili_room_info_h5` / `login_sooplive` / `get_sooplive_tk` / `get_winktv_bj_info` / `login_flextv`) switch from the uniform dict fallback to the `None` fallback — the dict returned by a failed `login_flextv` was once misjudged as a successful login by `if new_cookies`.
- **Duplicate-implementation consolidation**: the verbatim-duplicate `unzip_file()` in `node_install.py` and `ffmpeg_install.py` is consolidated into the single `src/utils.py` implementation (with Zip Slip validation); two `requests.get` calls in `node_install.py` are now managed by `with` to close connections.
- **Session lifecycle**: `sync_http.py` gains a `WeakSet` registry of thread-local Sessions, `close_session()` (explicit release for the current thread), and `close_all_sessions()` (registered with `atexit`, gracefully closing all connection pools on process exit).

**🧹 Style conventions / environment fixes (low)**
- **PEP 758 except style finalized**: real-machine testing showed black 26.x's stable style is the unparenthesized `except A, B:` (adding parentheses fails the format gate instead), so the report's alternative was adopted and recorded explicitly in `AGENTS.md` under "Code style → Black" (syntax legality guaranteed by the `requires-python >= 3.14` floor).
- **venv ghost problem fixed**: the editable install in `.venv` originally pointed at another checkout (`D:\DouyinLiveRecorder-coding`); after reinstalling with `pip install -e .`, `import src.*` resolves to this workspace, eliminating the "edited directory A, tests ran directory B" problem.

**🧹 Repo-wide mypy clean-up**
- `tests/test_quality_tiers.py`: 5 sites gain `assert mock.await_args is not None` before `.args` access (typeshed declares `await_args` as Optional; the runtime guarantees non-None but mypy cannot narrow).
- `gui_legacy.py`: 4 fixes — hover-effect lambdas converted to named closure factories, the `command` parameter annotated `str | Callable[[], Any]`, `optionxform` assigned via a named function + `setattr` (following the `gui.py` convention), and the `collections.abc.Callable` import added.
- `scripts/extract_i18n_strings.py`: dynamic `getattr` results narrowed with `cast` (the `warn_return_any` gate), removing the now-useless `type: ignore`.
- **Standalone single-file build**: 4 warnings cleared in `douyin_live_recorder_standalone.py` — `cast` on `json.loads` return values, an `isinstance(sign, dict)` guard in `_douyu_sign` (non-dict returns `None` directly, eliminating a runtime crash), and a new `PlatformResolver` Protocol so the `PLATFORM_RULES` dispatch table supports `proxy=`/`cookies=` keyword calls; the unused `Callable` import removed.

**🧪 Tests and verification**
- `tests/test_cookie_cache.py` strengthened: `test_same_loop_reentrant_no_deadlock` now also asserts "5 coroutines gathered concurrently fetch exactly once" (the assertion necessarily fails under the old RLock implementation — exactly the target behavior of this fix); all 26 cases pass. 4 assertions in `tests/test_spider_platform.py` that pinned the old dict-fallback behavior were updated to expect `is None`.
- Full `pytest`: **806 passed / 2 skipped / 0 failed**; repo-wide `mypy` (src + tests + all entry points + build_exe + scripts): **102 source files, 0 issues** (green across the 39-file CI scope, the 44-file report scope, and the 94-file scope including tests); basedpyright errorCount=0 / warningCount=0; black 105 files unchanged; isort fully compliant; compileall 0 syntax errors.
- web_tray live check: `WinDLL` loads successfully and the window-patching chain runs without exceptions (under headless, `GetConsoleWindow` returns empty and is skipped as expected).

### v4.0.9.2 (2026-08-28 ~ 2026-08-30) — Web panel manual recording control / Huya & Douyu fine-grained Blu-ray quality tiers / runtime log archiving on recording stop / performance review optimizations landed (P1~P5) / probe-backoff window self-healing & Huya FLV-first / Web background log-sink rebuild / GUI parent-process log-handle isolation

> This version advances four main lines — controllability, quality granularity, high-concurrency performance, and operability: the Web panel drops auto-start recording and gains manual "Start/Stop recording" control (a global switch + 7 interrupt points in the recording chain + tiered graceful ffmpeg termination); Huya/Douyu gain fine-grained Blu-ray tiers (BD4M/8M/20M/30M with a full select → pull → nearest-downgrade chain); the performance review landed five optimizations P1~P5 (per-round source-probe time for 80 rooms cut from 12.7s to 1.15s), and three rounds of real-machine verification root-fixed the Huya cold-start "probe false-green → ffmpeg 403" dead loop (backoff window aligned to the main loop + clear-on-success + Huya FLV-first) plus the issue of Web background-mode logs going to the hidden console window; as of 08-30 the stop-recording flow uniformly archives the four runtime logs by renaming them with a timestamp (conflicts get increments, missing files are skipped, handles are closed first), GUI parent-process and recorder-child log-handle isolation root-fixes the `streamget.log` rotation WinError 32 (silent total loss of recorder logs), and the i18n catalogs were replenished to 516 entries with `zh_CN.mo` recompiled. **No breaking changes** (config items and runtime semantics fully compatible; flipping Huya's candidate order to FLV-first is a behavior change, while Douyu keeps HLS-first). For detailed root cause and verification, see [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**🎥 Web panel manual recording control (new feature)**
- Global switch `main.recording_enabled` (defaults to True; CLI/GUI direct runs are entirely unaffected): Web sets it to False before starting the recording engine, so the panel **no longer auto-records**; after clicking "Start recording", the main loop spawns room threads one by one from the URL config, while config hot-reload, the concurrency scheduler, and danmaku monitoring keep running throughout.
- **7 interrupt points** injected into the recording chain: the ffmpeg poll (1s period), chunk-level direct download, room-thread entry, direct-download failure classification exclusion, wait-period interruption, the pre-spawn check in the main loop, and the thread-exit finally fallback (`remove_room_from_running` idempotently cleans the running list so a room can be spawned again after restart).
- New `POST /api/recording/toggle` endpoint (inside the existing Bearer auth middleware) and a `recording_enabled` field in the status snapshot; the frontend gains "Start/Stop recording" buttons with a running-state label, continuously synced to the real state by the dashboard's 2s polling (double-click protection, engine-alive gating).
- **Stop semantics are active tiered graceful termination**: when the poll observes the switch off, ffmpeg is terminated via a three-level escalation "stdin 'q' (flushes the file trailer so TS/FLV/segments stay intact) → terminate → kill" (30s total window); the process is waited on and de-registered — no orphan ffmpeg. Stop interrupts are not counted as error samples (preventing false per-host circuit breaking and error-backpressure downsizing).
- `recording_enabled` is a session-level runtime switch and is not persisted: the panel returns to the stopped state after restart, avoiding re-introducing "auto-record on startup" through the back door.

**🎚️ Huya/Douyu fine-grained Blu-ray quality tiers (new feature)**
- Quality-code layer expansion: `QUALITY_LEVEL` / `QUALITY_MAPPING_BIT` / `QUALITY_CODE_TO_ZH` grow from 6 to 10 items (adding `BD30`/`BD20`/`BD8`/`BD4`) plus the frozen `BD_SUB_TIERS` set; `get_quality_index` folds Blu-ray sub-tiers into the `BD` slot, leaving the digit-input 0–5 tier semantics of Douyin/TikTok-style platforms fully unchanged.
- Huya: new `HUYA_FIXED_TIERS` (ratio = bitrate ceiling in kbps, appended to the FLV/HLS URL query for tier selection without changing the URL path); the `exsphd` tier table takes priority with `gameLiveInfo.bitRate` as fallback for deriving available tiers; an unavailable requested tier **downgrades to the nearest lower tier** with an explicit warning (requested tier / room ceiling / actual tier), and falls back to Origin quality when no lower tier exists — the chain never breaks.
- Douyu: new `DOUYU_RATE_BY_CODE` / `DOUYU_RATE_TO_CODE` / `DOUYU_RATE_DESC`; when a requested tier is restricted (e.g. login-gated Origin), a **local retry chain falls back up to 2 tiers** along the total order; the real tier after the server's "nearest clamp" is read back via the `rate` field (measured: requesting rate=8200 with no such tier gets clamped to rate=4 → BD4M). Douyu has no 20M/30M tiers — selecting them requests Blu-ray 8M.
- The Web panel's quality dropdown gains the BD30M/BD20M/BD8M/BD4M options; real-machine ffprobe sampling confirms each tier's resolution/frame rate matches the tier table (Origin 2560×1440@60, BD30M~8M 1920×1080@60, BD4M 1080p30, Ultra 720p30, Smooth 450p24).

**📼 Runtime log archiving on recording stop (new feature)**
- Two trigger points: the Web panel's "Stop Recording" **archives immediately** (the process keeps running; log handles are rebuilt right after archiving, so logging for the recorder engine and the Web service is unaffected); every process-exit path — CLI Ctrl+C / the GUI stop button (CTRL_BREAK) / console close / disk-full / uncaught exceptions / the Web tray exit — archives uniformly through `main.py`'s atexit hook (registered before the two cleanup hooks; atexit is LIFO so archiving runs last, sweeping the ffmpeg-cleanup and other final logs into the archived files).
- Archiving rules: the four runtime logs (`streamget.log` / `PlayURL.log` / `danmaku_monitor.jsonl` / `web_console.log`) are renamed to "originalname_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext" (timestamp taken when the stop operation happens); conflicting targets automatically get `_1`/`_2` sequence suffixes without overwriting, missing files are skipped, a single failed rename only warns — the **stop-recording flow is never interrupted**; after archiving the logging pipeline is restored immediately and the next recording recreates fresh same-name files.
- Handle safety (on Windows, renaming a file with an open handle raises WinError 32): loguru file sinks are closed via `remove()`, which first flushes the async queue; the danmaku-monitor sidecar is closed via `close_file()` and reopens automatically on the next event; `web_console.log` is closed, renamed, then recreated and re-bound to `sys.stdout/stderr` plus the console sink (bound only in Web background mode; a leftover file not bound to any standard stream is only renamed, never hijacking the current stdout).
- Safety guards: the GUI parent process (`DLR_GUI_PARENT=1`) and test processes (`DOUYIN_DISABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE=1`) always return early, never renaming logs the recorder child is writing or the developer's real working-copy logs.

**⚡ Performance optimizations (review landed P1~P5)**
- **P1 probe-client reuse across the whole selection round**: all candidates in `select_source_url` share one `httpx.Client` (closed in `finally`, with UA/Referer/Cookie sent per-request); per-round source-probe time for 80 rooms × 10 probes drops from **12.7s to 1.15s**, and the concurrent connection peak actually falls from 4 to 1. A module-level global client cache is deliberately avoided (Huya's CDN rate-limits by connection budget; a resident keepalive would compete with the immediately following ffmpeg pull), and it was measured that **disabling keepalive "for safety" is forbidden** (it worsens to 8 connections / 72.99ms, giving back all the gains).
- **P2 thread-local `requests.Session` reuse**: `sync_http` keeps one Session per thread via `threading.local` (all 125 call sites benefit), measured 11.9ms → 1.47ms per request.
- **P3 set-based dedup containers in the main loop**: `url_comments` / `line_list` / `url_line_list` switch from list to set (membership checks O(N²) → O(1)), with `url_comments.discard` replacing the per-line whole-list rebuild.
- **P4 incremental scheduler counting**: the breaker window and the global error window are maintained incrementally (O(1) instead of an O(40) full sum under lock), shortening lock hold time.
- **P5 hot regexes hoisted to module-level constants**: five in-function `re.compile` sites (~400-char emoji pattern, URL fragments, HLS bandwidth, Douyin HEVC, etc.) are hoisted; `update_config_line`'s per-key regexes are cached via `functools.lru_cache`.

**🐛 Bug fixes (derived from real-machine verification)**
- **Probe-backoff window self-healing (root cause of the Huya false-green dead loop)**: the original fixed 60s backoff window was shorter than the main loop's default 120s interval — after a fast failure was recorded into the backoff, the next round arrived at T+124s when the window had long expired, so the "CDN probe backoff" warning never once appeared in historical logs; now `_probe_backoff_window() = max(60s, loop interval + 70s)`, covering the worst cadence of "one round = interval + ±5s jitter + another +60s when the error window fills 5 times".
- **Clear probe backoff on recording success**: new `clear_ffmpeg_reject()` pairs with the failure-side `mark_ffmpeg_reject` — a recovered link is no longer skipped within the window, falling back to a worse line for nothing.
- **Huya flips to FLV-first**: three rounds of real-machine runs proved that all three HLS CDNs (hs/tx/al) probe false-green on cold start (probe 200/206, ffmpeg gets 403 on open) while FLV is stable every round (up to 6 minutes of continuous recording) — Huya's candidate order becomes FLV → HLS → record_url, cutting cold-start false-green losses from ~2 minutes to 0 (Douyu is never added: its guest-mode FLV is cut by the CDN after ~70s and must stay HLS-first); h265 candidates are removed at unified-sequence construction time, no longer wasting probes. Real-machine comparison: 5 fast failures / 12 minutes to stabilize before, 1 fast failure / 2 minutes after.
- **Web background-mode log-sink rebuild**: a loguru sink binds to the concrete object at `add()` time and does not follow a later `sys.stderr` reassignment — without a rebuild, all DEBUG/WARNING goes to the SW_HIDE-hidden console and `web_console.log` keeps only print output (this once led to misreading "probe false-green" as "validation never ran"); `logger.py` gains `rebind_console_sink()`, `web.py` rebuilds the sink after background redirection, and a `sys.stderr is None` guard is added (root-fixing the import-time silent crash under pythonw / frozen executables).
- **Two-pass review fixes for the recording control**: the frontend state-label selector defect (the container is a class but an `#id` selector was used, so the label never toggled, P1) and 2 more.
- **GUI parent-process log-handle isolation**: the GUI process (which initializes file sinks via the `src.web_config → src/__init__ → src.logger` import chain) and the recorder child process both held `streamget.log` open — whichever side crossed the 300 KB rotation threshold had to rename first, and the other's open handle raised `PermissionError: [WinError 32]`, so rotation never succeeded and the recorder child's file logs were silently lost in full (measured: stuck at 300031 bytes, the GUI panel flooded with Logging errors); `src/logger.py` gains the `DLR_GUI_PARENT` environment marker (the GUI process writes only its own exclusive `gui.log` and never creates the recording log files) and `child_process_env()` (builds the recorder child's env, stripping the marker and pinning UTF-8 output), with `gui.py` setting the marker **before** importing any src module; only GUI mode was affected — CLI / Web single-process recording behavior is unchanged.
- **Type fix**: `src/stream.py` completes the `bitRate: int` field declaration of the `HuyaGameLiveInfo` TypedDict and removes the `# type: ignore` (newer mypy reports `call-overload` on the degraded type of an undeclared key) — zero runtime semantics change, `mypy src/` back to fully green.

**🔧 CI / engineering maintenance**
- **i18n four-language catalog completion (507 → 516 entries)**: the 9 new log strings introduced by the archiving feature were added to `zh_CN.po` / `en_US.json` / `en_GB.json` / `zh_TW.yaml` (Traditional Chinese following the existing vocabulary conventions: 日志→日誌, 文件→檔案, 归档→歸檔, 句柄→控制代碼), with `zh_CN.po` gaining a "Log Archive Module" section and `zh_CN.mo` recompiled (`--check` byte-level sync); the extractor re-scan reports 0 missing and the four-catalog keyset equality assertion passes.
- **Repo metadata sync-list alignment**: a consistency audit of the nine config files (`AGENTS.md` / `docker-compose.yaml` / `requirements.txt` / `Dockerfile` / `.gitignore` / `.dockerignore` / `.coveragerc-concurrency` / `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`) — dependencies identical in all three places (20=20), `uv lock --check` in sync, Dockerfile (python:3.14-slim + Node 24) ≡ CI (`python_build=3.14` / `node_version=24`), the version chain via `check_version.py` fully passing; 2 drifts fixed: `.v2c/` (a video2code plugin directory) added to 9 sync points — `.gitignore` / `.dockerignore` / the five pyproject tool exclude lists / `.coveragerc-concurrency` / the canonical AGENTS list; `.mypy_cache/` added to `.dockerignore` (previously `COPY . .` would ship it into the build context).

**🧪 Tests and verification**
- Archiving-specific: new `tests/test_log_archive.py` (14 cases: regex lock on the rename format, `_N` sequence dedup without overwriting, empty directory skips all, a single failed rename doesn't interrupt the batch, GUI/test-process guards, both `reopen_streams` semantics, web_console bound-handle rotation, lazy reopen after hub `close_file`, sink remove→add round-trip idempotency, and a static lock on main.py's archive atexit registration order); `test_web_api.py` gains a "stop triggers archiving" case; `tests/conftest.py` sets `DOUYIN_DISABLE_LOG_ARCHIVE=1` (a pytest exit is not a "stop recording" event, so the developer's real logs are never renamed).
- Added `tests/test_quality_tiers.py` (29 cases: sub-tier mapping / index folding / Huya nearest-downgrade / Douyu retry chain) and `tests/test_logger_console_sink.py` (3 cases: follow current stderr / replace not append / silent on None); `test_stream_select.py` gains whole-round client reuse with per-request headers, backoff window covering the main-loop period, clear-on-success, Huya FLV-first and Douyu-stays-HLS-first cases; `test_record_failure_feedback.py` gains a "stop-recording interrupt is not sampled" case; `test_web_api.py` gains recording-toggle endpoint cases.
- Full `pytest`: **806 passed / 2 skipped** (0 warnings; 15 new cases since 08-29); black / isort / `compile_po.py --check` / `mypy src/` (Windows + Linux, with `stream.py:609` fixed alongside the bitRate declaration) / `uv lock --check` / `check_version.py` all green. One known type-gate leftover remains (5 basedpyright `await_args` optional-member accesses in `test_quality_tiers.py`) — it does not affect runtime.
- Three rounds of real-machine verification (Huya 880214 / chuhe, Douyu 3168536): the backoff warning appears for the first time, FLV records steadily for 6 minutes, `web_console.log` regains full DEBUG/WARNING; Douyu's rate-clamp readback behavior matches measurements; a Windows black-box verification of the real loguru chain confirms `remove → rename → re-add` archiving works (the old file stays fully intact and the fresh same-name file is recreated immediately).

### v4.0.9.1 (2026-08-27 ~ 2026-08-28) — High-concurrency scheduler hardening / localization system fixes / compile & circuit-breaker gate fixes / CI workflow optimization and retry consolidation

> This version is a review-fix and hardening batch for the 4.0.9 scheduling system, plus a wrap-up of the localization subsystem: full quality gates and parallel code review uncovered and fixed several high/medium-severity defects, the i18n catalogs were fully replenished to 496 entries via a repo-wide AST scan, the i18n module syntax block was removed, and `zh_CN.mo` was recompiled; on 08-28 a CI workflow optimization (retries consolidated into a composite action), PEP 758 formatting landed via black 26, and an eight-file repository metadata sync were appended. **No breaking changes** (config items and runtime semantics are fully compatible). For detailed root cause and verification, see [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**✨ New features**
- **Web config line-append API**: `web_config.py` gains `append_config_line(config_file, section, key, value)`, a line-level append that builds a missing key/section (complementing the existing `update_config_line`), enabling safe writes to key-less configs.
- **Language-switch write-back degradation**: `web_api.py`'s `PUT /api/language` write-back now calls `append_config_line` to append at section end when line-level replacement fails, so a missing `language` key in historical config.ini no longer returns 500.
- **Full i18n catalog replenishment (288 → 496 entries)**: AST-scanned all runtime `print()`/`logger.*()` constant strings (47 files, 355 strings) and added 204+ translations (concurrency-scheduling logs, the full stream-URL validation set, the Bilibili buvid auth chain, danmaku capture/monitoring, seven-channel push-failure branches, ffmpeg/Node.js install, config read/write, etc.); the four-language key sets are fully identical.
- **CI network-install retry composite action (`.github/actions/retry`)**: a new composite action uniformly wraps pip / apt / choco / brew network-install commands with linear-backoff retries (`command` / `label` / `attempts` / `backoff` parameterizable), replacing 13 nearly identical inline retry scripts across the two workflows (9 in ci.yml + 4 in build-release.yml) — action.yml is the single source of truth for retry strategy, one change takes effect everywhere; verified via success/failure dual-path simulation.

**🐛 Bug fixes**
- **i18n localization system block (high-severity)**: `i18n.py` (3 sites) and `scripts/compile_po.py` (1 site) had Python 2-style `except A, B:` multi-except clauses (one with three-exception commas) changed to `except (A, B):`, removing the Python 3 hard `SyntaxError` that previously prevented `i18n` from being imported, blocked `.mo` compilation, and disabled CLI/GUI/Web localization; after the fix they are valid on both the managed 3.13 and 3.14 runtimes, and `zh_CN.mo` was recompiled (496 entries, `--check` byte-level synced).
- **CI black gate (PEP 758 formatting)**: those 4 tuple-parenthesized sites were then unified back to the bare-comma form by black 26.5.1 (`target-version=['py314']`, same version locally and in CI) per its PEP 758 normalization (`except A, B:` and `except (A, B):` are fully equivalent and semantically identical on 3.14), restoring the CI `black --check` to green; **these 4 sites are now owned by black — do not hand-edit the parentheses**.
- **Always-true compile-sync gate (P1)**: `scripts/compile_po.py`'s `write_mo()` now produces output purely in memory (removed the write-to-disk side effect), with the flush decision moved up to the caller, so `--check` no longer writes then reads back and compares against itself (previously always true) and now really compares against the committed `.mo`; the ci.yml paths-filter now includes `i18n/**`, so pure translation changes also trigger the static gate.
- **Circuit-breaker probe-lease self-healing (high-severity)**: root fix for the `PlatformBreaker` half-open probe leak — when the probe round ends via `continue` without reporting a sample, the `_probing` flag never resets and the host stays permanently circuit-broken until restart; a probe lease (`_PROBE_LEASE_SECONDS = 60s`) re-grants an unreported probe after timeout, enabling self-healing.
- **Scheduler success-sampling gap (medium-severity)**: the parse-success branch of `start_record` now reports `record_success(record_host)` (symmetric with the failure branch), so other rooms on the same host no longer starve while a half-open probe room is in a long recording.
- **Direct-download circuit-breaker sampling gap (P1)**: in `main.py`, the direct-download branch's "non-200 / network exception" failures were previously swallowed inside the function as `False` and the caller reported no sample, so bad links bypassed per-host circuit-breaking and were retried forever; a `record_error(record_host)` report was added (interrupted by comment/exit flag is not counted).
- **Scheduler thread-safety + type/logging**: `ConcurrencyScheduler` config fields are now locked (single-lock snapshot + in-lock write), eliminating the theoretical race between the main thread and the `adjust_loop` daemon; `notify.py`'s three-arg `getattr(main, "scheduler")` became direct attribute access (removing the Any leak that made mypy falsely green), and the three bare `logger.error(e)` calls in `run_script` now carry the exception type and command context.
- **Missing direct-download logs**: `main.py`'s `direct_download_stream` now logs the request URL on the non-200 branch and `{type(e).__name__}` on the exception branch (on Windows, `str()` of timeout exceptions is empty); `async_http.py` two bare `logger.debug(e)` calls were normalized to a URL/type-prefixed format.
- **Per-round danmaku-arg reset restored**: the inner monitor loop in `main.py` again resets `record_danmaku_args = None` at the top (a prior refactor had merged the in-round reset points).
- **Corrupted YAML catalog causing 500**: `_load_yaml_catalog()` now also catches `yaml.YAMLError` (not an OSError/ValueError subclass), degrading to the next format.
- **Missing ISSUE_TEMPLATE version**: the Python-version dropdown in all four `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` files adds `Python 3.14`.
- **Two i18n extractor noise sources**: `scripts/extract_i18n_strings.py`'s `is_valuable()` now judges by the residue outside brace blocks (pure-placeholder templates like `{color}{text}` are no longer falsely reported as missing), and the po header empty `msgid ""` is excluded before comparison (removing the "missing 1" false positive in the four-language consistency check); after the fixes a re-run confirmed zero missing entries (318 valuable strings all present, 496 per catalog).

**🎨 UX optimizations**
- **Frontend hardcoded Chinese moved into the translation dictionary**: `web/app.js` ~10 hardcoded Chinese strings now go through the inline four-language dictionary `t()` (recording/danmaku empty states, truncation hint, toggle/action toasts, config/file-list empty states, enter/download buttons, etc.), so English/Traditional-Chinese UIs no longer show Simplified Chinese.
- **GUI crash-dialog dedup**: top-level exceptions in `gui.py` no longer produce double dialogs / doubly-stacked logs; after `_bootstrap_error_sink` sets the flag, the excepthook triggered by the re-raise skips it.

**🔧 CI / engineering maintenance**
- **CI workflow optimization (ci.yml rewritten; job and gate semantics unchanged)**: `actions/checkout` v5→v7 and `setup-python` v6→v7 (aligned with build-release.yml to eliminate version drift); apt installs gained hardening flags (`DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` + `Acquire::Retries=3` + `--no-install-recommends`, more resilient to network jitter); the macOS `brew trust aws/tap` became a separate idempotent step and `HOMEBREW_*` variables moved to inline `export`; header comments gained the job topology diagram and the "verification only, no deployment" responsibility boundary.
- **Eight-file repository metadata sync**: corrected the stale `src/danmaku/` path comments in requirements.txt / Dockerfile to the actual module locations; `.dockerignore` gained 16 exclusions (local tool directories / `uv.lock` / `scripts/` / bilingual docs, slimming the build context); `.gitignore` added `.mimosa/` etc.; pyproject cleaned of dead directories; the docker-compose example version aligned to `4.0.9.1`; `AGENTS.md` module count 39→41 plus a new CI/workflow conventions section.

**🧪 Tests and verification**
- Added `tests/test_record_failure_feedback.py` (5 → 7 cases) and `tests/test_web_api.py` missing-key-build/edge cases; `test_scheduler.py` probe-lease self-healing (15 → 16) and `test_i18n.py` corrupted-YAML degradation (adapted to the new `write_mo()` signature).
- Full `pytest`: **744 passed / 2 skipped**; black / isort / mypy (Windows + Linux dual platform) / basedpyright all green; `compile_po.py --check` byte-level synced and the extractor reports zero missing; both workflow YAMLs passed structural assertions (needs chains / retry call counts / action version counts).

### v4.0.9 (2026-08-23 ~ 2026-08-24) — High-concurrency multi-platform recording scheduler optimization / recording-feedback loop / dual concurrency modes / Python 3.14 upgrade and language-key migration / four-language catalog unification and British-American split / type and CI quality-gate fixes

> This batch focuses on the scheduling-hub governance for high-concurrency (80+ tasks) multi-platform recording, the recording-side feedback loop, and the Python 3.14 baseline upgrade. For detailed root cause and verification, see [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**🚀 High-concurrency scheduling hub (new src/scheduler.py)**
- Introduces `ResizableSemaphore` (runtime-resizable capacity), `PlatformBreaker` (per-host circuit breaker with closed→open→half-open state machine), `ConcurrencyScheduler` (adaptive global concurrency capacity, default floor 8 / ceiling 128, gently throttling under high error rate but never below the safe floor), and `host_of(url)`.
- Replaces the old "global fixed 3-slot semaphore + one-way error-rate suppression" model, supporting 80+ concurrent cross-platform recordings with reduced queueing latency; single-platform interface jitter is isolated and degraded instead of cascading to the whole system.
- Wired in only at fixed integration points in `main.py` / `notify.py`, leaving the 50+ platform dispatch/recording functions untouched (backward compatible); adds the new config item "最大同时录制数(0=不限制)" ("max simultaneous recordings, 0=unlimited", default 0).

**🔁 Recording-result feedback loop (root-cause fix for the Huya 403 retry loop)**
- Fixed missing recording-side feedback: `check_subprocess` previously neither reported a failure sample by exit code nor (at round end) unconditionally reported success, diluting the per-host circuit-breaker stats so they never tripped — Huya rooms infinitely re-hit the dead "probe 200 → ffmpeg 403" route.
- Now reports success/failure samples by host by exit code; a fast ffmpeg failure (CDN-reject signature) triggers `mark_ffmpeg_reject` probe backoff (60s) so the next round tries the next CDN candidate instead of retrying the same dead line (backoff allowlist limited to Huya only).
- The console status line now shows the scheduler's real-time concurrency capacity (`_live_network_capacity`) instead of the misleading static config value.

**⚙️ Dual network-concurrency modes (dynamic / fixed)**
- Adds a "fixed concurrency" mode on top of adaptive capacity: "最大同时录制数(0=不限制)" also acts as a mode switch — =0 enables dynamic throttling (capacity adapts to active task count, floor 8 / ceiling 128); ≠0 ignores the dynamic throttler and pins capacity to "同一时间访问网络的线程数" ("threads accessing the network at once", hot-reload takes effect immediately, minimum 1 slot).
- Per-host platform circuit breaking is orthogonal to the mode and works under both; the simultaneous-recording cap is still governed by `scheduler.set_recording_limit` and unaffected by mode switching.

**🐍 Python 3.14 upgrade + language-key migration (general maintenance)**
- Project baseline raised from Python 3.10 to `>=3.14` (pyproject.toml / Dockerfile / full CI chain); fixed `async_http.py` compatibility where `asyncio.get_event_loop()` no longer implicitly creates an event loop under 3.14.
- `config.ini` language key `language(zh_cn/en)` unified into `language`: empty follows system language, illegal values fall back to en_US, GUI/Web panels hot-switch without restart, and old keys are auto-migrated at startup.
- Fixed 21 Python 2-style `except A, B:` legacy syntax errors across 14 source files so the project imports/tests under Python 3; full `pytest` **714 passed / 2 skipped / 0 warnings**, black/isort/mypy/basedpyright all green.

**🌐 Four-language catalog unification and British/American split**
- Unified zh_CN.po / en_US.json / en_GB.json / zh_TW.yaml to the same 288-key set (original 282 + 6 build/smoke constant strings added from build_exe.py).
- Fixed en_US's internally mixed British spellings (now consistently American: minimizes/minimized/canceled); en_GB was previously a clone of en_US, rewritten as genuinely British (minimise/minimises/minimised/cancelled), differing from en_US in only 4 spelling-sensitive entries.
- Recompiled zh_CN.po → zh_CN.mo (compile_po.py --check confirms byte-level sync), with no runtime-logic changes.

**🧪 Type-check / CI quality-gate fixes**
- Fixed two CI `mypy src/` errors: `i18n.py`'s `ctypes.WinDLL` platform gate (`sys.platform != "win32"` early return, clean on both ends), and `src/recorder_status.py`'s three-arg `getattr` changed to direct attribute access (eliminating the `no-any-return` leak).
- Fixed CI `pytest` assertion failure under C/POSIX locale where `detect_system_language()`'s `locale.getlocale()` fallback did not filter `("C", "POSIX")`; replaced 4 `patch.dict(os.environ)` calls in tests with `monkeypatch.setenv/delenv` (per AGENTS.md mandatory convention, avoiding the Windows 32767-char env limit overflow).
- Fixed `src/config_io.py`'s `read_config_value()` write-back crash where Python 3.14 throws `InvalidWriteError` on `write()` for keys containing a delimiter (now fully serialized to an in-memory buffer and flushed to disk only on success, with bad-key rollback).
- Repo-wide black 26.5.1 + `target-version=['py314']` reformat (stripping PEP 758 `except (A, B):` parentheses); local dev venv upgraded to 3.14.7; all four quality gates green under the 3.14 environment.

**📦 Build / dependencies / platform adaptation**
- Version bump `4.0.8.3` → `4.0.9` (single source of truth); `requires-python` raised to `>=3.14`, classifiers narrowed to 3.14 only; added `PyYAML>=6.0.3` dependency (for i18n's zh_TW.yaml support).
- `Dockerfile` base image upgraded to `python:3.14-slim-bookworm`, Node.js source `setup_22.x` → `setup_24.x`; CI matrix synced to 3.14.
- `src/spider.py`'s Migu `get_migu_stream_url()` now uses the rewritten `migu.js` that outputs the complete URL with `ddCalcu`/`sv` params (dropping the local stale fixed `sv=10010`); FFmpeg download source switched from `wweb.lanzouv.com` to `wwasx.lanzout.com`.

### v4.0.8.3 (2026-08-19 ~ 2026-08-22) — Auto anchor-name update / SSL config consolidation / four-language i18n / FFmpeg9·Node24 compatibility / type-safety hardening / start_record complexity governance / windowed-crash hardening / type-check defect fixes

> This version builds on the 4.0.8.2 fixes with several new capabilities and low-level compatibility, closing out with all five quality gates (mypy / basedpyright / pytest (0 warnings) / black / isort) green. For detailed root cause and verification, see [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**👤 Auto anchor-name update (new feature)**
- Each time `URL_config.ini` resolves the latest anchor name, if it differs from the config, the config file is auto-written back; when an anchor renames, the recording folder named after them and all related files inside (TS/FLV/danmaku SRT/subtitles with the same prefix) are renamed in sync, keeping path references intact.
- Added `src/config_io.py:update_anchor_name` + `main.py:rename_anchor_directory`; the rename only happens when that room is not recording (filesystem first, then config file; switch the name used this round only after both succeed); config toggle `是否自动更新主播名(是/否)` (default "yes", hot-reload supported), skips custom stream addresses and blank nicknames.

**🔒 SSL / HTTPS config consolidation**
- The old "是否强制启用https录制" + "是否禁用SSL证书验证(是/否)" are merged into a single "是否启用https录制": enabled = https pull + skip cert verification, disabled = http pull + default strict verification. The old key is read-only migrated and written back, not rebuilt.
- The main loop hot-syncs `set_https_recording` / `set_ssl_verify` each round; when disabled, `https://` → `http://` (https-only overseas platforms like TikTok/YouTube keep their original form, avoiding inevitable pull failure).
- The platform-level override `禁用SSL证书验证的平台(逗号分隔符)` only takes effect in http mode (when cert verification is needed); required platforms (Huya Live / Bilibili Live) are auto-appended at startup, with only appends and no removal of user-entered items.

**🌐 Four-language i18n rebuild + instant switching**
- `i18n.py` rebuilt: multi-format catalog loading (gettext `.mo` → `<lang>.json` → `<lang>.yaml`), `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` (zh_CN/en_US/en_GB/zh_TW), `normalize_language()` alias normalization, `set_language()` hot switch (no restart).
- The zh_CN catalog is completed to 282 entries; en_US/en_GB/zh_TW translations are newly added; the Web top bar + GUI sidebar language selectors switch instantly and persist (Web via `GET/PUT /api/language`); no longer depends on the `LANG`/`LANGUAGE` environment variables. zh_TW requires PyYAML (missing only loses that format).

**⚙️ FFmpeg 9.0 / Node 24 compatibility baseline**
- Repo-wide ffmpeg command audit aligned to FFmpeg 9.0 (released 2026-08-04, TLS cert verification on by default), removing deprecated CLI args and the dead `-v verbose` param; `-tls_verify 0` is uniformly arbitrated via `get_effective_ssl_verify`.
- `src/javascript/migu.js` fully rewritten: adapts to Migu player mgprtcl.wasm interface changes (imported functions 3→12, export names rearranged, crypto factors now delivered via the interface), fixing the fatal `LinkError` on instantiation under any Node version in the old script; outputs the complete signed URL (the old version only output the ddCalcu value). Dockerfile Java/Node source upgraded to 24.x LTS.

**🧪 Type-safety hardening (all five tools green)**
- mypy tests/ went from 435 errors → 0 (auto-annotation of ~420 sites + manual fix of ~60 real type issues); basedpyright tests/ 0 errors / 0 warnings / 0 notes; pytest **699 passed / 2 skipped / 0 warnings**; black / isort pass repo-wide.
- New test coverage: 5 language API, 10 new i18n features, 3 SSL platform auto-append, 2 new SSL semantics, 1 migu output contract, 21 auto anchor-name update.

**🧹 start_record complexity governance (code quality)**
- The platform-dispatch if/elif chain (52 platform branches) in `main.py:start_record` (originally ~1600 lines) is extracted into a standalone module-level function `_resolve_platform_stream`; the recording execution control flow is unchanged; this eliminates 19 masked `possibly unbound` (removes the always-true redundant `if real_url:` wrapper, cleans up dead casts, fixes the `record_name` binding), and simultaneously fixes the "recording chain must not be nested inside a condition" anti-pattern. The basedpyright "too complex" error is eliminated.

**🧩 Type-check defect fixes (code quality)**
- `i18n.py`: `import yaml` gets a `# type: ignore[import-untyped]` to suppress the optional-dependency missing-stub hint (preserving the runtime degrade "missing only loses YAML format" semantics per AGENTS.md); the degrade branch `yaml = None` is changed to `yaml: Any | None = None` with an explicit annotation.
- `gui.py`: `messagebox` changed from attribute-style `_tk.messagebox` to an explicit `from tkinter import messagebox as _mb` import (two crash popups), eliminating `reportAttributeAccessIssue`; the thread hook `_thread_dump` adds an `if args.exc_value is None: return` guard when `args.exc_value` is `None`, eliminating the `BaseException | None` incompatibility error.

**🪟 Windowed-run crash observability hardening (defect fix)**
- Fixed the problem where running the GUI via `pythonw.exe` (and the `console=False` frozen exe) produced **no window and no error at all**: root cause was `src/logger.py` calling `logger.add(sink=sys.stderr, ...)` at import time, which throws `TypeError: Cannot log to objects of type 'NoneType'` when `sys.stderr=None`, silently exiting on the import chain. **Added a `sys.stderr is not None` guard** so the console sink is skipped in no-console environments and `logs/streamget.log`, `PlayURL.log` file sinks act as fallback.
- `gui.py` adds `_install_crash_sink()` at the top: before **all risky imports**, install `sys.excepthook` / `threading.excepthook` to write the full stack of uncaught exceptions (including import-time failures) to `%TEMP%/douyin_recorder_gui_error.log` and best-effort show an error box, root-causing the silent windowed death; UI callback exception branches switch to the in-program "run log" queue, and `__main__` keeps the raw console stack via `try/except`.

**📚 Architecture doc update**
- `CODE_WIKI.md` completed with the danmaku collection subsystem (base class / collector / 5 platform clients / monitor hub / SRT / WS / visitor Cookie cache / protobuf), `src/platforms` and `src/proto` module descriptions, module dependency graph, and design patterns; version corrected to 4.0.8.3 (aligned with `pyproject.toml` single source of truth).

### v4.0.8.2 (2026-08-16 ~ 2026-08-18) — Recording/danmaku/i18n/type-check series of fixes

> This batch concentrated on fixing several long-standing "runs but recording/danmaku often fail" issues, verified via real-device end-to-end testing. Outlined by module below; detailed root cause and verification in [CODE_WIKI.md](../../CODE_WIKI.md).

**🎯 Recording engine core fixes (affects all platforms)**
- **Fatal structural bug**: the recording main chain was nested inside the `if headers:` condition, causing platforms without dedicated request headers (Douyin/Douyu, etc.) to **never actually record** (only showing "live"). Fixed — the condition only controls request-header insertion; the recording chain runs unconditionally.
- **Douyu crash fix**: when `select_source_url` returns empty, no more `UnboundLocalError` (title variable unbound) — it warns and waits for the next round; the last-resort candidate's content-type rejection and m3u8 Range-GET occasional 403 now support "retry once before judging / last-resort warn-and-pass", root-causing Douyu HLS false-red and FLV ~70s CDN cut.
- **Three-layer stream-URL check risk reduction**: added "probe throttling + retry jitter + backoff after rejection (Huya only)" to eliminate the 403 failure loop caused by CDN fingerprinting the bot-pace rhythm; the checker and ffmpeg now use **byte-for-byte identical** User-Agents (self-consistent fingerprint, preventing check false-red/false-green).
- **HTTPS/SSL config consolidation**: `是否启用https录制` (merging the old `是否强制启用https录制` and `是否禁用SSL证书验证(是/否)`) — enabled = https pull + skip cert verification, disabled = http pull + default cert verification. For the "Huya Live" platform, protocol conversion is skipped (its `*.hls.huya.com` is http-only); https-only overseas platforms like TikTok/YouTube keep https as-is when disabled, avoiding inevitable pull failure.

**🐯 Huya specifics (multi-CDN source selection + Referer correction)**
- Changed to **enumerate all CDN candidates** (HS/HW/TX/AL) instead of always taking the first or always preferring TX; uniformly downgraded to `http://` while preserving original anti-leech params, then `select_source_url` checks reachability one by one and picks the best, dynamically avoiding any offline line.
- **Referer rule removed**: Huya CDN now validates in reverse — **with a Referer it always returns 403; without a Referer, the HS line returns 200**. The historically injected Referer rule had become the cause of recording failures and is now cleared.
- The App path (`get_huya_app_stream_url`) does the same `tars_mp→huya_webh5`/`bhct→bgct` param substitution as `record_url` when TX is selected, root-causing the regression where "after priority source selection, TX still carried the original `tars_mp` causing second-level stream drops".

**📺 Bilibili danmaku auth chain closed**
- Fixed the spi endpoint spelling (`/finger/sp` → `/finger/spi`, the missing trailing `i` caused 200+empty body); the buvid fetch chain adds a `www.bilibili.com` homepage Set-Cookie backup path, and distinguishes a real buvid from a random-UUID fallback (marked `is_fallback`).
- The danmaku room-entry packet **passing the anchor uid as the viewer uid** (causing AUTH soft-rejection — connection kept, 0 danmaku) is fixed; `_decode_packet` explicitly checks the code of the operation=8 response, and on non-zero warns + disconnects + invalidates the buvid cache (avoiding a rejected-UUID infinite loop), plus a new 8-second silent-rejection watchdog.
- The danmaku triple (OD/BD/UHD app paths) returns are completed, eliminating the original silent skip.

**🌐 i18n mechanism fix**
- Supplied the missing `zh_CN.mo` compiled artifact and ships it with the repo; `init_gettext` changed to explicitly load `languages=["zh_CN"]`, **no longer depending on the `LANG`/`LANGUAGE` environment variables** (generally unset on Windows). English prompts in a Chinese environment (e.g. "IP banned") are now correctly translated.

**🍪 Unified visitor Cookie cache**
- Added `src/cookie_cache.py`: a process-level shared cache keyed by "normalized URL + proxy", so common visitor cookies like Douyin ttwid and Kuaishou did are reused across modules/rooms from a single copy, **eliminating repeated fetches of the same URL triggering risk control**.

**🧩 Architecture and quality**
- `main.py` split 6 categories of functionality into `src/` submodules (ffmpeg_proc / video_postprocess / stream_select / notify / recorder_status / config_io), kept compatible via re-export; the danmaku subpackage `src/danmaku/*` flattened into `src/`; comment convention applied: all `"""` docstrings converted to `#` line comments.
- Config robustness: when `config.ini` is not writable, the `import main` stage no longer crashes (best-effort read-back); old keys are read-only, not written back; backup rotation deletion changed to best-effort.
- Repo-wide UA uniformly upgraded to the 2026 baseline (Chrome/141, Firefox/148, mobile Android 14 Chrome/141), eliminating stale fingerprints.

**🛡️ Platform compatibility and runtime robustness**
- **Cross-event-loop lock misjudged as risk control, root-caused** (`src/async_http.py`): the module-level singleton `asyncio.Lock()` lazily bound to the first room's `asyncio.run()` loop, so when later rooms started new loops and awaited it again, it threw `bound to a different event loop`, which `async_req` swallowed and returned an empty string, causing `spider.py` to misjudge "risk-control empty response" and cascade into failed HTML-scrape fallback. Now caches/rebuilds a `(lock, loop)` pair per **current event loop** (consistent with the `_client_cache` mechanism); `tests/test_async_http.py` adds `TestGetClientLock` to lock this behavior.
- **Blank exception log containment**: `async_req` / `_close_all_clients` and the old cross-loop client-close sites originally used `logger.debug(e)`, which under Windows prints blank logs when the exception's `str()` is empty and cannot be located; all changed to include `type(e).__name__` (with the URL when necessary).
- **Platform compatibility fixes**: `web.py` ctypes 3.13+ compatibility (`windll` removed) + 64-bit `HWND` truncation causing console-window hide failure, switched to `ctypes.WinDLL` with explicit `argtypes`/`restype`; `main.py` fixed PATH concatenation overwriting later appends / duplicate inserts (now uses live `os.environ["PATH"]` with dedup); `msg_push.py` fixed the unbound `tg_bot` variable (`NameError` crash) and missed Telegram business failures (`{"ok": false}` not detected), success marker changed to chat_id.

**🧪 Static check / CI hardening**
- mypy / basedpyright fully cleared in `src/` and `main.py` (including spider.py / sync_http.py / web_api.py `_FAILED_LOGINS` completing `deque` type params to eliminate 10 cascading warnings); `main.py`'s `get_startup_info()` changed to return `object | None` (with `sys.platform == "win32"` gating kept) to root-cause the Windows-specific typeshed symbol cross-platform `TYPE_CHECKING` alias false positive; `gui.py` / `build_exe.py` / `web.py` / `msg_push.py` concurrently basedpyright 0/0/0, mypy pass.
- Script robustness: `scripts/check_coverage.py` fixed global coverage < 50% silently skipping the gate, temp-file leftovers, and `subprocess.run` missing `encoding` (crash on Windows non-UTF-8 locale); `scripts/smoke_test.py` fixed Windows GBK console `UnicodeEncodeError` crash and constant redefinition, changed failure markers to ASCII, added `_safe_print` fault tolerance.
- CI `lint` job Python upgraded from 3.12 to 3.13 (aligned with the highest `target-version`, eliminating AST safety-check warning noise); `black --check .` format violations manually fixed.
- Full test run ~635 passed / 2 skipped (excluding known sandbox delete-protection items).

### v4.0.8.1 (2026-08-01 ~ 2026-08-09) — Comment convention / smoke testing / GUI graceful exit / check fixes, consolidated

**Comment convention and quality baseline**
- Module/function docs uniformly use `#` line comments, no longer triple-quoted `"""` docstrings.
- Full audit passed: `compileall` / `black` (line-width 120) / `isort` / `mypy` (src/) / `pytest` all green (417 passed, no regression; 08-01 increment 78 passed, `ruff` also passed); fixed 2 black format violations.
- ⚠️ **Build bug fix (`pyproject.toml`)**: `email="ihmily@github"` is not a valid IDN email, so new setuptools refuses to build and `pip install .` always fails; changed to `ihmily@users.noreply.github.com` (CI bare install did not trigger this, **local dev always hits it**).

**New Web/API smoke-test tool**
- `scripts/smoke_test.py` (**zero-dependency, config-driven**): supports GET/POST, `base_url` concatenation, expected status code, text/JSON assertions; outputs console/JSON/HTML reports; non-zero exit code on failure. The default case `scripts/smoke_web.json` probes the Web panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

**GUI stop-recording graceful-exit hardening**
- **Root cause**: when `pythonw.exe` launches the GUI, `sys.executable` points to the console-less pythonw, so the recording subprocess it spawns is also console-less → `AttachConsole` must fail, CTRL_BREAK structurally unreachable; now when pythonw is detected, the recording core is launched with the same-directory `python.exe` (console subsystem) instead. **The packaged version (CLI exe `console=True`) is unaffected**.
- CTRL_BREAK failure falls back to `taskkill /F /T /PID` whole-tree termination (with ffmpeg cleanup); logs honestly distinguish "graceful exit" from "hard-kill path".
- Verified: after reproducing the pythonw parent process, `AttachConsole` succeeds and the `SIGBREAK` handler fires (`signum=21`); also, Python 3.13's `time.sleep()` is not woken by CTRL_BREAK (uses the pending-call mechanism), but since `main.py`'s recording main loop has no long sleep (≤5s), `safe_exit` will execute cleanup within the 15-second window.
- ⚠️ **Leftover (unchanged)**: the old `gui_legacy.py` launches subprocesses with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, so `send_signal(CTRL_BREAK_EVENT)` is silently ineffective and graceful stop never worked (always waited 15s then force-killed); **migration to gui.py is recommended**.

**Stream-URL check fixes (HLS/proxy/log)**
- Blank-log containment: `get_response_status` exception logs now include the URL and exception type (e.g. `ConnectTimeout`/`TimeoutError`), eliminating Windows `socket.timeout`'s empty `str()` printing only blanks.
- m3u8 misjudgment fix: HEAD probe range extended from `400/401/403/405` to **all non-2xx including 404**; for `.m3u8` a `Range: bytes=0-0` GET probe is always added (200/206 = reachable), avoiding usable HLS sources being mis-fell-back to FLV.
- `_validate_stream_url` adds a `verify` param honoring the global SSL toggle, with all failure paths logging warnings (URL + exception type/status code/content-type).
- `select_source_url` adds `proxy_addr` and forwards it to the three check sites, fixing TikTok and other proxy-required platforms being mis-judged unreachable on direct-connect timeout.

**Douyin recording enhancements**
- Supports 5 URL formats: web/app live room, Douyin-id concatenation (incl. VR), app/web anchor profile.
- The anchor profile (format 5) directly extracts `sec_user_id` to skip redundant downloads, cutting requests 4→3; profile-type links now correctly forward `proxy_addr`/`cookies` (fixed silent loss); added a `sec_user_id → Douyin id` process-level cache (30-min TTL).
- When the CDN returns 4xx to HEAD, a `Range` GET probe is added; on the occasional `status_code=10002` first failure, `web/enter` silently retries once, skipping the ~1MB HTML fallback scrape; dead code `get_douyin_stream_data` removed.

### v4.0.8 (2026-07-30) — Web panel / quality monitoring / proxy and type fixes

- **New Web management panel** (`web.py`+`src/web_api.py`+`src/web_config.py`+`web/`): dashboard, room management, config editor, SSE log push.
- **New GUI quality monitoring**: real-time check of whether actual quality matches the setting, covering Douyin/TikTok/Kuaishou/Huya/Douyu/Bilibili/NetEase CC, seven platforms.
- **New config items**: `web_show_console` (hide and run in background), global SSL cert-verification toggle (config.ini), log-file toggle.
- **Connection optimization**: HTTP client reuses connection pools by (proxy, verify, http2); proxy detection changed from network probing to reading local system proxy config.
- **Defect fixes**: `trace_error_decorator` sync decorator misused on 71 async functions causing error capture to fail; `asyncio.run()` causing httpx cross-event-loop reuse issues; multiple IndexError/KeyError/type errors.
- **Credential cleanup**: hardcoded expired credentials changed to auto-fetch (Douyin ttwid, Kuaishou did, Twitch Client-Id, etc.).
- **Build/deps**: Dockerfile upgraded to Node.js 22 LTS, non-root run; added `pydantic>=2.0.0` dependency declaration; repo-wide type-check (Pyright/Pyrefly/basedpyright) cleanup.
